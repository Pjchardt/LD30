A Horse With Two Names

Built for Ludum Dare 30, A Horse with Two Names is a game about using the code and assets that create the game being utilized in a second way as the content to use to solve the riddles of the game.  This game stems from my interest in the artificats of game creation, a fancy terminology for code, assets and the other ingredients that are necessary for a game experience.  What happens to these artifacts?  And what are the aesthetic qualities of these artifacts?

I built the game in Unity, unfortunately as a result Unity is needed to play the game, as some clues are found in the source code but others require investigating the Scene of the game in the Unity Editor.  Were I a more experienced programmer, and probably requiring more time as well, I would much prefer to use a far more lightweight engine or write a very simple engine for the game.  As it is now, the game has a 4GB barrier to entry :(  Hopefully some devs who already use Unity will find the premise of AHWTN interesting enough to play, and I thank you and hope you can take something positive from the experience.  

To play simply run the executable.  The game will prompt for numerical codes to be input to solve each riddle.  The answers to each riddle are found in the code and the scene.  You will need to open the project in Unity.  

In the repo are all of the cource files as well as the builds for WIndows, Mac and Linux.

Sincerely,

@pjchardt
